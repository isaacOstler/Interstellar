// THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF INTERSTELLAR (These commandments relate specifically to node.js code, not cards)
// 1)   Thou shalt follow the styling guide (see style_guide.txt).
// 2)   Thou will ****LINT YOUR CODE*****, we use ESLint.  
// 3)   Comments are required for every line, regardless of how painfully obvious the operation is.
// 4)   Functions do one thing and do one thing well.
// 5)   The index.js file (this file) should be easy to read
// 6)   We are lightweight.  We try to use minimal libraries and npm packages.  The closer to native javascript, the better.
// 7)   Never use synchronous code
// 8)   Our console logs everything
// 9)   We always follow the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
// 10)  COMPARTMENTALIZE everything.  We should be able to easily replace modules.
