			The Voyager has hundreds of officers on board for normal ship operations, however not all officers are on duty at any given time.  Typically the crew is split into three shifts.  One shift will be on duty, operating the ship, while the other two are off duty.  On board the Voyager, shifts typically last 5 hours, and the ship operates on a 15 hour day (instead of a 24 hour work day).  The two off duty shifts are split between the resting shift (a mandatory resting period of 5 hours), and training/leisure time.  During training/leisure time, officers may either spend the time training and attending classes, or spending the time how they see fit (such as watching movies, spending time in holodecks, or resting).

			During normal ship operations, this shift rotation is ideal.  It allows officers that need rest and leisure time to recuperate, while still ensuring that ship postings are covered.  However, when the ship is in a potentially dangerous situation (such as a battle) all crew members should be on hand and ready to respond.  This can be achieved through alert status.<br /><br />

			The ship wide alert status is a quick and efficient way to prepare the ship's crew for an upcoming crisis.  There are 5 different alert conditions that can be used... let's take a look at them now.
